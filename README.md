# Notice:

I created this project as a means to continue what Recode had in terms of importing NBS files onto Diamondfire. This mod adds some features to improve the experience involving noteblock songs by making them easier to import and set up.

You are allowed to fork and modify this mod however you like, but uploading to mod websites will not be permitted. Contributing can be done in the form of Pull Requests.

# Features:

- ```/nbs load``` Imports songs using the format on [Recode](https://github.com/homchom/recode)
- ```/nbs load_custom``` Imports songs in a similar format, but the pitch values are raw ```key + fine pitch``` values multiplied by 1000
- ```/nbs gui``` Opens an experimental GUI for importing songs(currently only Recode format)

# Planned Features

- Gui shows more data about each song file
- Selectable format for importing in GUI
- Config Menu
- (Maybe) Client-Side player for previewing and reducing noteblock ping lag.
